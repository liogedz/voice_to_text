```text
Replace `YOUR_ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` in `Main.java` with your own API key.
```

- use your own source of audio for transcription, put into

```java
private static final String AUDIO = "https://www.your-audio.source";
```

## ▶️ Compile & Run

- IDE will do compile work, add language level, maybe create `out` directory
- Without IDE:

```bash
mkdir out
javac -cp "lib/*" -d out src/*.java
java -cp "lib/*:out" Main
```

## 📦 Dependencies

This project intentionally avoids a build system.

- Included library (committed under /lib):
- `Gson` – JSON serialization/deserialization

They are committed so the project can be run without any setup.

## 🧠 Design Notes

- HTTP calls use java.net.http.HttpClient
- JSON parsing uses Gson
- Polling uses `ScheduledExecutorService`
- The project favors clarity and minimalism over frameworks
